## Agent Schema

```json
{
  "id": "agent-0001",
  "name": "Tara Night",
  "type": "historian",
  "capabilities": ["chronology", "narrative", "context", "research"],
  "birthday": "2024-04-17",
  "memory_hash": "707b1913cc1abe94",

## API Access

```bash
# List all agents
curl https://cmd.blackroad.io/agents

# Get specific agent
curl https://cmd.blackroad.io/agents/agent-0001

# Create new agent
curl -X POST https://cmd.blackroad.io/agents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Nova Helix", "type": "physicist"}'
```

## Memory System

Each agent has a unique `memory_hash` generated using PS-SHA∞:
```
hash = sha256(name:birthday:blackroad)[:16]
```

This hash is used for:
- Memory persistence in D1 database
- Append-only journal addressing
- Truth state commits
